# The $100 Legend: The Story of the Adidas Forum

In the world of sneakers, few silhouettes carry as much historical weight as the **Adidas Forum**. Originally released in 1984, it wasn't just a basketball shoe—it was a statement of intent. At a time when the sneaker industry was beginning to explode, the Forum arrived with a triple-digit price tag and a design that changed the game forever.

### Born for the Hardwood
The story begins in 1983. Adidas designer **Jacques Chassaing** set out to create more than just a shoe; he wanted a performance tool that could support the increasingly physical play of modern basketball. He spent months observing players, focusing on the most common point of failure: the ankle.

The result was the revolutionary **"Criss-Cross Ankle System."** By integrating an X-shaped strap that mimicked the way athletes taped their ankles for support, Chassaing provided stability without sacrificing mobility. When the Forum officially debuted in 1984—just in time for the Summer Olympics—it featured a premium leather upper, a durable cupsole, and the "Dellinger Web" on the midsole for shock absorption.

### The "Money" Shoe
Today, we don't blink at a $200 sneaker release. But in 1984, the Adidas Forum’s **$100 retail price** was unheard of. It was the first basketball shoe to hit that "magical" three-figure mark, earning it the nickname "The Money Shoe." 

Because of this price point, the Forum instantly became a status symbol. It moved off the court and onto the streets of New York, Detroit, and Chicago. If you were rocking Forums, you weren't just a hooper—you were someone who had arrived.

### The Jordan Connection
Before he was "His Airness" with a Jumpman logo, **Michael Jordan** was an Adidas fan. During the 1984 Olympic trials, a young MJ famously wore the Adidas Forum High. It’s one of the great "what ifs" in sneaker history: if the contract negotiations had gone differently, the Forum might have been the foundation of the Jordan empire. Instead, it remained the crown jewel of the Three Stripes' basketball category, worn by legends like Patrick Ewing.

### From the Court to the Culture
As the 90s arrived, the Forum’s bulky, technical aesthetic found a second home. Skateboarders began adopting the shoe for its incredible durability and "board feel," while the hip-hop community embraced its aggressive silhouette. It was the first Adidas model to be offered in **High, Mid, and Low-cut** versions, offering a versatility that few other shoes of the era could match.

### The Modern Revival
After a period in the archives, Adidas brought the Forum back in 2020, and the response was electric. By staying true to the OG "84" specifications—using higher-quality leathers and the original yellowish-tinted midsoles—Adidas tapped into the vintage "Aged" trend perfectly.

Collaborations with heavyweights like **Bad Bunny**, **Jeremy Scott**, and **Ivy Park** have introduced the Forum to a whole new generation. Whether it’s the classic Blue Thread colorway or a modern platform "Bold" edition, the shoe remains a masterclass in balance: it’s technical yet wearable, retro yet timeless.

### Final Thoughts
At **HuntingForKicks**, we believe every shoe has a soul, and the Forum’s soul is rooted in the golden era of 80s design. It’s a shoe that survived the transition from elite performance gear to a streetwear icon without losing its identity. 

Forty years later, the "X" strap is still a symbol of style and support. The Forum didn't just tell a story in 1984—it’s still writing it today.
