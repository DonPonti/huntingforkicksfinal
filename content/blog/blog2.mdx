## The Origin

It started on the court, but it lives on the street. The Air Jordan 1 is not just a shoe; it is the canvas upon which modern sneaker culture was painted.

### The Design
Peter Moore's design was simple. Color blocking that could be remixed infinitely. That is the secret. It is not about the technology; it is about the *color*.
